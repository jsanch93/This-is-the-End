      <p>
        Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it <br>
        Man, I hate this part of Texas <br>
        Close my eyes, fantasize <br>
        Three clicks and I'm home <br>
        When I get back, I'll lay around<br>
        Then I'll get up and lay back down<br>
        Romanticize a quiet life<br>
        There's no place like my room<br>
      </p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <p>But you had to go, I know, I know, I know <br>
        Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore <br>
        Not even the burnouts are out here anymore <br>
        And you had to go, I know, I know, I know <br>
      </p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
      <p>
        Out in the park, we watch the sunset <br>
        Talkin' on a rusty swing set <br>
        After a while, you went quiet <br>
        And I got mean <br>
        I'm always pushin' you away from me <br>
        But you come back with gravity <br>
        And when I call, you come home <br>
        A bird in your teeth <br>
      </p>      
    </figure>

    <figure>
      <p>
        So, I gotta go, I know, I know, I know <br>
        When the sirens sound, you'll hide under the floor <br>
        But I'm not gonna go down with my hometown in a tornado <br>
        I'm gonna chase it, I know, I know, I know <br>
        I gotta go now, I know, I know, I know <br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Drivin' out into the sun <br>
        Let the ultraviolet cover me up <br>
        Went looking for a creation myth <br>
        Ended up with a pair of cracked lips <br>
        Windows down, scream along <br>
        To some America First rap-country song <br>
        A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall <br>
        Slot machines, fear of God <br>
        Windows down, heater on <br>
        Big bolt of lightning hanging low <br>
        Over the coast, everyone's convinced <br>
        It's a government drone or an alien spaceship <br>
        Either way, we're not alone <br>
        I'll find a new place to be from <br>
        A haunted house with a picket fence <br>
        To float around and ghost my friends <br>
        No, I'm not afraid to disappear <br>
        The billboard said "The End Is Near" <br>
        I turned around, there was nothing there <br>
        Yeah, I guess the end is here <br>
      </p>      
    </figure>

  <figure>
    <p>
      The end is here <br>
      The end is here <br>
      The end is here <br>
      The end is...<br>
    </p>
